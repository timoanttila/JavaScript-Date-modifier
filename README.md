# Svelte Date modifier

I hate using extra third-party libraries, so I developed a component for Svelte that can change the format of time as desired.

The component changes the date to `21.06.2021 15:48`.
If `i` is not empty, an abbreviation of the day appears before the date (example `sun`).

If you have any tips on how I could get the extra at "klo" off without replaceAll, post a message.
